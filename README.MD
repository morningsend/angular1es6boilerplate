Angular + WebPack + ES6 Boilerplate
===================================

There plenty of webpack boilerplate code out there. This is something I set up
to let anyone quickly get started with using Angular 1 and ES6.

Webpack bundles the code into two bundles: `bundle.js` and `vendor.bundle.js`.
Run `npm run build:dev` to create a bundle.
